I've been using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage my Python environments. It's a great tool, but I recently encountered an issue with the `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable.

## The Problem

The issue arose when I was using uv to remove a package from what I thought was my activated virtual environment:

```
(cbsim) ➜  cbsim git:(km/mle-1722/evaluation-harness) ✗ uv remove papermill
warning: `VIRTUAL_ENV=/Users/khalil/Desktop/cbsim/.venv` does not match the project environment path `.venv` and will be ignored
```

The error message revealed the root cause: my `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable was pointing to an absolute path that didn't match uv's expected relative path.

## The Solution

I located the issue in my virtual environment's activation script (`cbsim/.venv/bin/activate`) where the `VIRTUAL_ENV` variable was incorrectly set to:
```bash
VIRTUAL_ENV="/Users/khalil/Desktop/cbsim/.venv"
```

I updated it to the correct relative path:
```bash
VIRTUAL_ENV="/path/to/expected/.venv"
```

After reactivating the virtual environment, uv commands worked as expected.

## Prevention

This mismatch likely occurred because the virtual environment was created or moved after initial setup. To avoid this issue:
- Always create virtual environments in your project root
- Recreate the virtual environment if you move your project directory
