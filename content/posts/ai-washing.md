The promise of generative AI is exaggerated in the short-term and underestimated in the long-term leading to an uncontrollable hype.

Naturally, many choose to ride this hype with false advertisement to further their agenda — whether it is to drive up stock prices or to win customers. 

[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9xx8122893o) recently referred this false misrepresentation of the benefits of AI (to businesses) as "AI washing":

> It is a problem that has quietly existed for a number of years, according to data from another tech investment firm, MMC Ventures. In a 2019 study it found that 40% of new tech firms that described themselves as "AI start-ups" in fact used virtually no AI at all.

Amazon itself decieved customers into thinking that their "Just Walk Out" technology — that powered Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go shops — was primarly driven by AI. It turned out that [the system was supported by hundreds of works manually checking over 70% of the transactions](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133029/amazon-just-walk-out-cashierless-ai-india).

While should eventually expect regulation to tame the false promises of AI to customer, in the short term we must adapt to ridiculous ads like [an AI driven toothbrush](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9xx8122893o).

People charged with developing AI solutions have the impossible task to taming expectations and disabusing the believe the stakeholder have about AI being a silverbullet.
