## Hi, I'm Khalil

I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer based in Dublin.

I hold a PhD, and my work sits at the intersection of Personalisation, AI Engineering, Search, and Discovery. I'm driven by curiosity, creativity, and a relentless desire to build systems that are both intelligent and humane.

I spend most of my time thinking about how people find the things they care about—and how we can make that faster, smarter, and more meaningful.

Outside of building and shipping, I care deeply about how we communicate our work—because the best ideas deserve clear, elegant expression. I love to code, teach, and explore better ways to present complex ideas.

I'm guided by a simple belief: the world gets better when we stay ambitious—without stepping on others to climb higher.

If any of this resonates, you’re welcome to follow along. I write about ML systems, personalization, and what I’m learning. Occasionally, I send updates via a newsletter (still figuring out the right cadence!) and love connecting with thoughtful folks across the space.

This blog was crafted with care and curiosity. Thanks for stopping by.
