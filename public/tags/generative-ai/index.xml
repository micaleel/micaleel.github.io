      <description>The promise of generative AI is exaggerated in the short-term and underestimated in the long-term leading to an uncontrollable hype.
Naturally, many choose to ride this hype with false advertisement to further their agenda — whether it is to drive up stock prices or to win customers.

<p>Naturally, many choose to ride this hype with false advertisement to further their agenda — whether it is to drive up stock prices or to win customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9xx8122893o">BBC</a> recently referred this false misrepresentation of the benefits of AI (to businesses) as &ldquo;AI washing&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a problem that has quietly existed for a number of years, according to data from another tech investment firm, MMC Ventures. In a 2019 study it found that 40% of new tech firms that described themselves as &ldquo;AI start-ups&rdquo; in fact used virtually no AI at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazon itself decieved customers into thinking that their &ldquo;Just Walk Out&rdquo; technology — that powered Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go shops — was primarly driven by AI. It turned out that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133029/amazon-just-walk-out-cashierless-ai-india">the system was supported by hundreds of works manually checking over 70% of the transactions</a>.</p>
<p>While should eventually expect regulation to tame the false promises of AI to customer, in the short term we must adapt to ridiculous ads like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9xx8122893o">an AI driven toothbrush</a>.</p>
<p>People charged with developing AI solutions have the impossible task to taming expectations and disabusing the believe the stakeholder have about AI being a silverbullet.</p>
